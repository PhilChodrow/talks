### Gender is 

- Nonbinary
- Multifaceted
- Not defined by names, pronouns, appearance.

### Data

<br> <br> 

Complete scrape of the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org) (MGP) -- summer, 2021. 

"Gender inference": female/male gender guessed based on names (and in some cases country location): 

- `gender-guesser`, a Python package.  
- [genderize.io](https://genderize.io)
- [GenderAPI](https://gender-api.com)

[MGP is managed by the Department of Mathematics at North Dakota State University]{.footnote} 

:::
::: {.column}

### Tables

<br> <br> 

- `academic`: names, theses, 
- `advisor` relationships between academics. 
- `schools`: country locations
- `gender_pred` : predictions from inference services.

We also have 2-digit MSC numbers for `r p `% of all records in this timespan.

So we can do some analysis by subfield.

### Other Questions We Can Ask

:::

::: {.column}

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>       

- Who did their PhD at school $A$ and subsequently advised a thesis at school $B$? (proxy for hiring)
- Which mathematicians were at school $B$ at approximately the time that a given scholar was hired?
- Approximately how many female mathematicians were in the group of advisor $i$ at the time that a given student joined their group?

#### Homophily effects 

Do female advisors tend to recruit female students? 

Do departments with high female gender representation attract more female faculty or students?
