# Hypergraph Network Data Science: Developments, Challenges, and Opportunities 

A common recent refrain is that dyadic graphs are insufficient for analyzing network data that includes interactions between three or more agents. Much work has therefore focused on data science methods using polyadic data representations. Hypergraphs are one of the simplest such representations. In this talk, I'll give a nonexhaustive overview of some challenges and opportunities in hypergraph network data science. Drawing work by me, my collaborators, and many others, I'll try to address a simple question: what do we gain and what do we lose when we work with hypergraphs? I'll discuss examples including community detection, node embedding, and link prediction. Throughout, I'll argue that (a) hypergraphs afford much greater modeling flexibility than graphs and (b) this flexibility demands careful attention to the alignment between modeling assumptions and data features.
