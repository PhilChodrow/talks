# Agenda

1). Quick review of some evolutionary graph theory models (for contrast).

2). **Co**evolutionary models and competing timescales. 

3). Extended example: approximations for the adaptive voter model.

--

4). *(The hidden agenda): I want you to work on coevolutionary models.*

## Review: **Evolutionary Dynamics on Graphs**

.pull-left[.smaller[1. Choose an individual $i$ proportional to their current fitness $\phi_i$. 
1. Sample $j \in \mathcal{N}(i)$ proportional to $w_{ij}$. Then, $\phi_j\gets \phi_i$.
1. .alert[**Isothermal Theorem**]: This process has the same long-term selection dynamics as the complete graph $K_n$ iff $T_i = \sum_j{w_{ji}}$ is constant on $V$.

# Everything is Borked

1) Whole process is usually Markovian, but neither node- nor edge-upates are in isolation $\rightarrow$ no closed form anything. 

--

2) Edge updates tend to create long-range correlations between node states. $\rightarrow$ mean-field theories will usually perform poorly. 

--

3) What questions should we even be asking of these models??

# Example: Adaptive Voter Model (AVM)

Nodes have binary states $\in \{0,1\}$. 
At each time step $t$: 

Pick an edge $e = (u,v)$ where $u$ and $v$ disagree. 

- With probability $\alpha$, .alert[**rewire**]: delete $(u,v)$ and form $(u,w)$, where $w$ agrees with $u$ ("rewire-to-same") or $w$ is uniformly random ("rewire-to-random"). 
- With probability $1-\alpha$, .alert[**vote**]: $v$ adopts $u$'s opinion. 
	
Repeat until no disagreement is left.

Let's do an experiment!

# Model Timescales

In a world with only rewiring ( $\alpha = 1$ ), .alert[**coupon-collector**] dynamics would resolve all disagreement in time $\sim O(n \log n)$ on sparse graphs, $\rightarrow$ .alert[**segregated consensus**].  

In a world with only voting ( $\alpha = 0$ ), .alert[**voting dynamics**] would resolve all disagreement in time $\sim O(n^2)$, $\rightarrow$ .alert[**hegemonic consensus**].

# Discrete-Time Markovian Approximations


$$\underbrace{\mathbf{m}(t+1) - \mathbf{m}
(t)}_{\text{change in edge counts}} = \underbrace{\alpha\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x})]}_{\text{rewiring}} +\underbrace{(1-\alpha)\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{V}(\mathcal{G}(t))]}_{\text{voting}}$$

Second term is non-Markovian $\rightarrow$ no closed form. 

We can approximate it by tracking each discordant edge (under some modeling assumptions). 

Ugly bookkeeping, but easy solutions.

# Takeaways

Competing timescales of node and edge dynamics drive rich behavior even in simple systems. 

--

It seems like it helps to treat these systems as truly discrete, rather than resort to continuous-time approximations. 

--

This is a .alert[**great area**] for applied mathematicians, with potential applications in evolutionary dynamics and theoretical ecology.

**The best work here is yet to come!**
